# Dinner Recommendation for Alex

## Main Course
### Whole Wheat Vegetable Chapati with Paneer Tikka Masala 

### 1. Whole Wheat Vegetable Chapati
**Description**: This is a traditional Indian flatbread made from whole wheat flour, filled with grated vegetables for added fiber and nutrition.

#### How to Cook:
- In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of whole wheat flour and any grated veggies you like (e.g., carrots, spinach, or zucchini). 
- Add a pinch of salt and enough water to knead into a soft dough. 
- Divide into small balls, roll each ball out into a thin circle. 
- Cook on a non-stick skillet until brown spots appear on both sides. 
- Keep warm in a cloth until serving.

#### Improvise:
*If you have allergies to gluten, banana leaves or millet flour can be used for a similar flatbread preparation.*

### 2. Paneer Tikka Masala
**Description**: A deliciously spiced curry with paneer, marinated in yogurt and mixed spices, served with a tomato-based sauce.

#### How to Cook:
- In a bowl, mix 100g of plain yogurt, 1 tsp of turmeric, cumin, coriander powder, and salt. 
- Marinate cubes of paneer (about 200g) for at least 30 minutes.
- Skewered paneer cubes can be grilled or baked until slightly charred (about 15-20 minutes in a preheated oven at 400°F).
- For the sauce, sauté finely chopped onions, garlic, and ginger in a little olive oil until golden. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until mushy.
- Stir in the marinated paneer and allow it to simmer for 5 minutes. Adjust spices to taste and garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.

#### Improvise:
*For a vegan option, replace paneer with tofu, and use coconut yogurt instead.* 

### Side Dish 
### Cucumber Raita
**Description**: A cooling yogurt-based side dish that pairs really well with spicy curries.

#### How to Cook:
- Grate 1 cucumber and mix it with 1 cup of plain yogurt.
- Add ½ tsp cumin powder, salt to taste, and a sprinkle of chopped mint leaves.

#### Improvise: 
*To make it dairy-free, use coconut or almond yogurt instead.*

### Dessert (Optional) 
### Chia Seed Pudding with Coconut Milk
**Description**: A healthy dessert alternative that’s low in sugar and high in fiber.

#### How to Cook:
- In a bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of chia seeds with 1 cup of unsweetened coconut milk. 
- Add a few drops of vanilla and sweeten with stevia or a low-glycemic sweetener if desired.
- Stir and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour or overnight to thicken. Top with fresh berries before serving.

#### Improvise: 
*Adjust the liquid base for any allergies—use almond milk or oat milk as alternatives.*
